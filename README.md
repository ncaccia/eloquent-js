# Learning JavaScript

A structured journey through Eloquent JavaScript (4th Edition, 2024) by Marijn Haverbeke.

## Structure
```
    // One file per chapter. One notes file for everything. Simple.

    ├── README.md
    ├── learning_notes.md
    ├── chapter-01.js
    ├── chapter-02.js
    ├── chapter-03.js
    ...
    
```

## Process

**Daily commitment:** 2-3 hours  
**Approach:** One chapter at a time, no rushing

1. Read the chapter thoroughly
2. Add notes to `learning_notes.md` under the chapter heading
3. Complete all exercises in the corresponding `.js` file => use ´code runner´vsc extension to run code partially directly from the IDE.
4. Move on only when you actually understand, not when you finish

Notes get refined after completing each part of the book. First pass is rough. That's fine.

## Why This Works

Programming isn't learned by reading—it's learned by doing. This book teaches by building understanding from first principles. The exercises aren't busywork; they force you to think through concepts until they click.

Taking notes helps solidify abstract ideas. Writing code cements them.

## For Others Following This Path

If you're using this as a template:

- **Don't skip exercises.** They're where the learning happens.
- **Struggle is part of the process.** If something doesn't make sense immediately, that's normal. Sit with it.
- **Adjust the pace to your life.** 2-3 hours works for me. Find what works for you.
- **Iterate on notes.** Your first understanding won't be your best understanding.
- **Build things beyond exercises.** Apply concepts to projects that interest you.

## Progress

Currently on: Chapter 3, one branch per chapter.
